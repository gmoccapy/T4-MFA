Version 1:
first test, the LED need to be connected through the green and blue connectors,
some evaluation is complicated

Version 2:
Does contain a place to integrate a small board with photo resistors to evaluate the LED state.
I designed it for all 6 LED, even if my KI does only have 5 solderd on the board

Additional board needed, see main hardware folder
